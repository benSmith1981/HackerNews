Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.

As I mentioned in our call, we would like you to build a small mobile application to test your knowledge of iOS or Android technologies.


For the test, you can choose to complete it using any one of:

* Swift for iOS, supporting a minimum of iOS7 or iOS8, as an Xcode project
* Objective-C for iOS, supporting a minimum of iOS7 or iOS8, as an Xcode project
* Java for Android, supporting a minimum of Android 4.0, as an Android Studio project

Please refer to the attached wireframe for an understanding of what the finished app should look like.

On startup, and when the list view is pulled down to refresh, the app should connect to this API which shows recently posted articles about Android or iOS on Hacker News:



If you’re doing the task in iOS use:

http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?query=ios



If you’re doing the task in Android use:

http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?query=android



If the app is used offline, it should show the items downloaded last time.

The main view of the app is a scrolling list view of recent posts in date order. If the user taps on a post, show a web view (within the app) with the linked article. Also, you should be able to swipe on a cell, and delete an individual post from this view (see mockups). Once a post is deleted it should not reappear.

It is not necessary to create an optimised layout for tablet devices. 

You are welcome to use any 3rd party libraries to complete the task.

Send us your completed code - either as a public Github repo, or zipped and emailed to jobs@reigndesign.com. Include a README which explains anything we need to do to run the demo app, for example installing CocoaPods or a specific version of the ADT tools.

If you have any questions about the task, please let us know.


Once again, thank you for your time and we are looking forward to see the results!

Thanks,

- Fluxà
